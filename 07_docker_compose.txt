sometime we need to use multiple containers  ,, exmaple : in open sorufce contibuton we need to open multiple containers  .....   but there;s probelm fo in which order ?  in which port we need to run those image/contaienr s ?? 

for that there;s soltuon called docker composer ..


its aa script kind of thing ... in which we will get the script in which manner thsi container /  bunch of containers will run 

we can create /  update  .  destory multiple containers

to use docker-compose  


we need to create the file named as  .....    "docker-compose.yml"

example  :  we want to use postgres with port 5432 with environment variables and also i wnat to install redis with 6379 port then we will use below script in that file.


            version: '3.8'

            services:
            postgres:
                image : postgres
                ports:
                - '5432:5432'
                environment:
                POSTGRES_USER: postgres
                POSTGRES_DB: review
                POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password

            redis:
                image: redis
                ports: 
                - "6379:6379"


    Now to run this script run this command  >> sudo docker compose up     ,,,,  now it will take some time


now if u see your docker dashbaor dit will be runninga a Stack named as your folder name and it will be running the postgres and nodejs inside

now if we >> ctrl + c    ( it will stop that runnign stack)
        >> docker compose down (  it will remove that stack )
        >> docker compose up -d ( start the stack in background )
