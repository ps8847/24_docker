Docker is a kind of a container  ..

its is used for following kind of problem  : 

1) When we make a software as a developer .. it gives no Problem for a individual developer .
2) But when the development team scales up .. then it starts giving problem like differences starts coming in configutrations of the environ,ment and tools of that first developer

ex : the first dveeloper had nodejs8 , mongodb5 .....  but now after 1-2 years a new dveeloper joins the team and now he\she installs the nodejs and mongodb of latest version ... its will create differnces for the development team .. for the new commerse 


To solve this problem we can use DOCKER as a container  .. where we will setup our configuration as a systrem and will share that containeer to the team whoevcer will be employeed for the project
