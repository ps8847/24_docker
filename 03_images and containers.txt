IMAGES are we can say as a OPERATION SYSTEM OR ANY KIND OF SYSTEM ( manually created / OS) 

Contaienrs are the emopty spaces where the Images Run 

Example  :  a window11 is running on my machine  .....  then that widnow11 is IMAGE and my machine is CONTAINER

Here in DOCKER we can create our Custom image  .... as  [my-image-tools] it will contain Nodejs16 + Ubuntu +  mongodb5  ..... So   , i will share this image to my team and will sya them to run this Image on their Contaienrs
