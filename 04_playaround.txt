to run the docker just open it on desktop 


Now Open the terminal and Type 

  Note :  type ctrl+d to exit the docker
>> docker run -it ubuntu   (it will create ubintu image for our container)
>> docker container ls  ( it will list the containers in our docker image)
>> docker container ls -a ( it will show the containers in bit details ,, also the closed containers also  )

>> docker start (container_name)   ->  it will start that docker container
>> docker stop (container_name)   ->  it will stop that docker container

>> docker exec (container_name) ls  ( it will run the docker command for just one go  .. remains without leaving the actual CMD of your Os )
>> docker exec -it (container_name) bash   ( it will run and execute the command inside that container)

>> docker images ( it will list the images )


**********************

what if we want to install any other image also ? 

go to the hub.docker.com and choose the name of your image u want to install and run 

suppose we want to use NodeJs
>> docker run -it node

it will download and install the nodejs  ... and will open your terminal in repl of Nodejs




*************************

now suppose we want to open the server runnning on docker as localhost : 8000 .. but it will not run in our system then ...  to use them we need to expose that PORT 

we will install this below 

>> docker run -it piyushgargdev/mynodeapp

>> docker run -it p 1025:1025 <imagename (piyushgargdev/mynodeapp)>     ( it means expose the container's 1025 to my machine's 1025 )
>> docker run -d -p 1025:1025 -p 8085:8085 <imagename (piyushgargdev/mynodeapp)>     ( for multiple ports syntax )

now with postman or browser we will be able to fetch the 9000 port running inside the container



*************************


environomnet variables :

syntax : 
docker run -it p 1025:1025 piyushgargdev/mynodeapp -e key=value -e key=value piyushgargdev/mynodeapp
